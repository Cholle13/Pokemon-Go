# Pokemon-Go
CS 1430 Pokemon Go project
  
Okay.... So let's COOOOODDDDEEEEE  
I am not sure how to configure the SDL on the compiler I am currently using(Eclipse) but I will figure it out. Ya'll can make commits to the files if you do anything stupid we can always revert(but let's test the code before we commit :))  

## Ideas???  
Let's go ahead and assign people to different things and get this organized...(EDIT THIS TO CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANNA DO)  

Ben -   
Luke -  Spearhead documentation (flowchart and user manual)  
Parakh -  
Chris - Draw pokemon and backgrounds figure out how to set up SDL  
Josh -  

## Things that need to be done
1)  START  
2) Figure out how to set up SDL PLOTTER    
3) Create goals/rules for the game(MAKE A TEXT FILE AND ADD IT TO THE PROJECT)  
4) Start figuring out Functions we need to make  
5) Set up classes and structs we will need  
6) Figure out Sound???  
7) Design background and possible overlay HUD(CHRIS can work on this)  
8) Figure out how to throw a pokeball  
9) Do we wanna battle or just catch em all?  

## Tips on Typing in Markup  
1) double space at the end of each line to go to next line(ENTER key don't work)  
2) Hit the preview tab before you commit changes  
3) Commenting your commits are helpful for other to understand what you just did  
4) COMMENT YOUR CODE PLEASE WE ALL CODE DIFFERENTLY AND IT MAKES OUR LIFE EASIER  
5) [Here is a Cheatsheat on using markup](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  


## Setting up SDL  
[For Windows users using codeblocks follow steps here](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/codeblocks/index.php)
