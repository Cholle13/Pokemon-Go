## Setting up SDL

[Code::Blocks PC Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWGtuc5uqF4)
- The video is vague at times but it helped me.  
- Some tips   
    1) you don't need to watch the full video (I only needed to watch about 10 minutes of it)  
    2) Follow the steps closely  
    3) When he talks about the .dll files, just paste those into the project folder  
    4) don't forget to remove the comments in the .h file  


[Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/)  
[this looks like a good tutorial on VS](http://xeekworx.com/sdl2guides/14-sdl2guides-setupvs)  

[If you have a mac using codeblocks this works!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9BPEwEMDU)  
Ya'll will also have to get the SDL Mixer as well.. Link is posted below   
- So once ya'll get the Mixer you will have too...(For Mac)(ps. configure and make and sudo make install the file the same way you did in the video before moving on)  
1) Go to settings tab up top in code blocks  
2) Click on compiler... from the drop down menu  
3) then click on Linker Settings tab  
4) then on the Link libraries box: you will find and add button click it  
5) then search your lib file in your local folder and add the SDL2_mixer-2.0.0.dylib and the SDL2_mixer.a  
- I don't have code::blocks on a pc so not sure exactly how to do it but it should be similar to the mac... just watch the videos and add those two files in however you added them in for the pc :)  
- You need these [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and the [SDL mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
