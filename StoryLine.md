# StoryLine 

You've finally been granted your Pokémon Trainer's license. Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest Pokémon Trainer. 
It's going to take all you've got to collect 15 Pokémon in this region. Catch monsters like the shockingly-cute Pikachu. 

(this is probably going to be really bad so make edits pls.)

Booth      : Hello there! Welcome to the world of POKEMON! My name is DR.Booth!
            People call me the POKEMON PROF!
            
Booth       : This world is inhabited by creatures called POKEMON! For some
            people, POKEMON are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself...
            I study POKEMON as a profession.
            
Booth       : If a wild POKEMON appears, your POKEBALL can capture it!


## After a pokemon is caught

It could say like 

Booth     : Congratulations you caught "Insert Pokemon here"! 
            That is number 1 out of the 15 that you need to become the Pokemon Master!

We can use some prior game dialogue to base it off of. 
I am sure booth wont be able to tell.
