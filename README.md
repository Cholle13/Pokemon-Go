# Pokemon-Go
CS 1430 Pokemon Go project
  
Okay.... So let's COOOOODDDDEEEEE  
I am not sure how to configure the SDL on the compiler I am currently using(Eclipse) but I will figure it out. Ya'll can make commits to the files if you do anything stupid we can always revert(but let's test the code before we commit :))  

## Ideas???  
Let's go ahead and assign people to different things and get this organized...(EDIT THIS TO CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANNA DO)  

Ben -   
Luke -  Spearhead documentation (flowchart and user manual)  
Parakh -  
Chris - Draw pokemon and backgrounds figure out how to set up SDL  (HAS WORKING PLOTTER)  
Josh -  Moral Manager/Encouragement coordinator.

## Things that need to be done
1)  START  
2) Figure out how to set up SDL PLOTTER    
3) Create goals/rules for the game(MAKE A TEXT FILE AND ADD IT TO THE PROJECT)  
4) Start figuring out Functions we need to make  
5) Set up classes and structs we will need  
6) Figure out Sound???  
7) Design background and possible overlay HUD(CHRIS can work on this)  
8) Figure out how to throw a pokeball  
9) Do we wanna battle or just catch em all?  

## Tips on Typing in Markup  
1) double space at the end of each line to go to next line(ENTER key don't work)  
2) Hit the preview tab before you commit changes  
3) Commenting your commits are helpful for other to understand what you just did  
4) COMMENT YOUR CODE PLEASE WE ALL CODE DIFFERENTLY AND IT MAKES OUR LIFE EASIER

## Setting up SDL  
[This is a video for setting it up on PC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtUw_7CvRRo)  
[If you have a mac using codeblocks this works!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bi9BPEwEMDU)  
Ya'll will also have to get the SDL Mixer as well.. Link is posted below   
- So once ya'll get the Mixer you will have too...(For Mac)(ps. configure and make and sudo make install the file the same way you did in the video before moving on)  
1) Go to settings tab up top in code blocks  
2) Click on compiler... from the drop down menu  
3) then click on Linker Settings tab  
4) then on the Link libraries box: you will find and add button click it  
5) then search your lib file in your local folder and add the SDL2_mixer-2.0.0.dylib and the SDL2_mixer.a  
- I don't have code::blocks on a pc so not sure exactly how to do it but it should be similar to the mac... just watch the videos and add those two files in however you added them in for the pc :)  
- You need these [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and the [SDL mixer](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
